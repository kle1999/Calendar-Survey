<a name="about" class="anchor" href="#about"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About:</h1>

<p>The TIMELINE FOLLOWBACK (TLFB) is an interview-based assessment that was developed and copyrighted by Sobell &amp; Sobell (2000). The TLFB derives subjects' retrospective daily estimates of alcohol consumption patterns. Using a calendar as a visual aid, special events, and other memory cues, subjects are guided through the process of recalling and reporting daily drinking estimates.</p>

<a name="requirement-for-installing-the-tlfb" class="anchor" href="#requirement-for-installing-the-tlfb"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Requirement for installing the TLFB:</h1>

<p>The TLFB currently only run on Window opeating system. It can be installed by any IT Personel having access to a Window Server with Internet Information Services (IIS) and MS.SQL Server installed. Depend on your own institution security 's policy, the web application and the database server can be installed on the same box, however, for security purpose, we suggest that you install the Web Application Server on a separate box than the  MS SQL server that hosts the database. </p>

<p>The web application server is preferably a Window Server (2003/2005/2008) with Internet Information Services (IIS) installed. This box will need to be able to communite and authenticate with the MS SQL server box using port 1433. </p>

<p>The installer will need to have full administrative right on the Web Server as well as the SQL Server. He/She will also neeed to have administrative right for the MSSQL instance running by the MSSQL Server.</p>
