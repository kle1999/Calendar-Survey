{"name":"Calendar Survey","tagline":" TIMELINE FOLLOWBACK (TLFB) Calendar Survey","body":"About:\r\n======\r\n\r\nThe TIMELINE FOLLOWBACK (TLFB) is an interview-based assessment that was developed and copyrighted by Sobell & Sobell (2000). The TLFB derives subjects' retrospective daily estimates of alcohol consumption patterns. Using a calendar as a visual aid, special events, and other memory cues, subjects are guided through the process of recalling and reporting daily drinking estimates.\r\n\r\nRequirement for installing the TLFB:\r\n===================================\r\n\r\nThe TLFB currently only run on Window opeating system. It can be installed by any IT Personel having access to a Window Server with Internet Information Services (IIS) and MS.SQL Server installed. Depend on your own institution security 's policy, the web application and the database server can be installed on the same box, however, for security purpose, we suggest that you install the Web Application Server on a separate box than the  MS SQL server that hosts the database. \r\n\r\nThe web application server is preferably a Window Server (2003/2005/2008) with Internet Information Services (IIS) installed. This box will need to be able to communite and authenticate with the MS SQL server box using port 1433. \r\n\r\nThe installer will need to have full administrative right on the Web Server as well as the SQL Server. He/She will also neeed to have administrative right for the MSSQL instance running by the MSSQL Server.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n============\r\n\r\n1. Download the zip file above and unzip it or you can down the two files (a)calendarSurveyScript (b)calendarSurveySouceCode to your web server.\r\n2. Open MS SQL Server.\r\n3. Open Notepad, copy, paste and run the CalendarSurveyScript to the SQL server to create a new \"CalendarSurvey\" database.\r\n4. In MSSQL, create a new account with a role as database owner for the new database \"CalendarSurvey\".\r\n5. In MSSQL, use the \"CalendarSurvey\" database, open table \"investigators\". This is the table where you use to enter new login ID and password for new participant ID.  There is a default user with administrator right for the application has user name \"admin\" and password \"admin\".  Please change this default password.\r\n5. Unzip the \"CalendarSurveySourceCode\" to your web server root directory. Copy the folder \"carl\" to your web server root folder. Normally the web root directory is located in c:/inetpub/www/\r\n6. Modify the \"web.config\" file which is located in the root directory of the unzip \"calendarSurveySourceCode\" and look for the following line and change the properties for the databsse connection string.\r\n\r\n         <add key=\"ConnectionString\" value=\"server=yourDatabaseServerIPAddress;uid='LoginIDForTheCalendarSurvey';password='PasswordForTheCalendarSurvey';initial catalog='NameOfCalendarSurveyDatabase' \"/>\r\n\r\nIn the above connection string replace \r\n1. \"yourDatabaseServerIPAddress\" with your database server IP address,\r\n2. \"uid\" with the login ID you created in step 4 above\r\n3. \"PasswordForTheCalendarSurvey\" with the password for the account you created in step 4 above\r\n4. \"NameOfCalendarSurveyDatabase\" with the name of the databbase you created in step 3 above.\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthor:\r\n======\r\n\r\nKevin Le, MS, Center for Research Informatics, University of Chicago\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about the coding or installation, please contact\r\n\r\nKevin Le, MS, University of Chicago\r\n5751 S.
